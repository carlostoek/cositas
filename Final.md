[Environment & Optics]

Directly behind the physical setup hangs a flat, 2D painted canvas backdrop. The painting on the canvas illustrates a dimly lit cabaret lounge with small round tables, white tablecloths, glassware, and candles. 
Physical Foreground Set (Real 3D Objects): Heavy, dark crimson velvet curtains frame the extreme left and right sides, showing deep, real fabric folds and ambient occlusion. Flanking the woman are two real, physical, ornate tufted armchairs. The chairs are upholstered in tactile reddish-brown velvet with metallic gold trim that catches sharp specular highlights. A real, physical small round table stands to her left, holding a vintage metal microphone with sharp chrome reflections.
Above the background scene, a sign spelling "LOVE" in large, illuminated letters is visible. The letters are a warm white color and appear to be lit with small bulbs. A string of small lights is draped above the sign
