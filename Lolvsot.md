[Camera & Framing]
Raw DSLR fashion photography. Full  mid-torso height, slight low-angle.
Authentic photographic grain, natural sensor noise.
Very subtle, localized motion blur ONLY on fingertips, not global.

[Subject & Anatomy – HIGH PRIORITY]
Woman with long, voluminous, straight red hair.
Anatomical realism is CRITICAL:
Anatomical tension adapts to the pose: Visible muscle definition, realistic tendons on neck and arms, and authentic skin stretching/compression reacting naturally to her current sitting posture.
Skin texture must show:
- Visible pores
- Natural micro-creases at the waist where the body bends
- Subtle vellus hair on the arms
NO airbrushing, NO plastic skin, NO beauty smoothing.

[Pose & Clothing Physics – HIGH PRIORITY]
She wears a form-fitting, sleeveless red dress with a high slit on the left side.
The slit reveals black stockings and a visible garter belt.
Pose Base & Attitude (FIXED BLOCK)]
Stance: Standing confidently center-stage between the two armchairs. Her weight is shifted firmly onto one hip, creating a strong, grounded silhouette and a natural curve in the torso. Her body is squared towards the camera.
Expression: Direct, commanding, and unwavering. She locks eyes with the camera lens with a serious, intense, almost challenging gaze.

[Texture Details – Gloves – MEDIUM PRIORITY]
Hands wearing long, purple gloves made of matte velvet.
Velvet must absorb light, not reflect it.
Realistic fabric bunching and wrinkling at wrists and elbows.

[Environment & Scene Separation – MEDIUM PRIORITY]

[Background – Flat 2D Painted Canvas]
Behind the subject hangs a flat, painted canvas backdrop.
The painting depicts a dimly lit cabaret lounge:
- Small round tables
- White tablecloths
- Glassware
- Candles
All background elements are clearly flat, matte, and painted.
Canvas texture is subtly visible.
NO depth, NO real lighting interaction.
This background must feel distinctly 2D.

[Foreground – Physical 3D Set]
Foreground elements are fully real and three-dimensional.
Heavy dark crimson velvet curtains frame the far left and right edges.
Curtains show deep fabric folds and ambient occlusion.
Two ornate tufted armchairs flank the woman:
- Upholstered in tactile reddish-brown velvet
- Metallic gold trim with sharp specular highlights
A small, real, round table stands to her left.
On the table sits a vintage metal microphone with crisp chrome reflections.

[Set Decoration – LOW PRIORITY]
Above the scene, a sign spelling “LOVE” in large warm-white illuminated letters.
Letters appear lit by small bulbs.
A subtle string of small lights is draped above the sign.
